# About Project

The ASV Workbench is a proposed framework to interface design tools, written in Python, with databases representing physical objects in the vessel general arrangement and components metadata used to produce design calculation reports.
The suggested framework aims to address the lack of consistency between different design analysis and reports that are manually generated and depend on designer oversight of different documents.

The benefits are not limited to the increase of productivity but also include the introduction of a parametric design tool that allows design iteration, team collaboration and easy maintenance of components and metadata parameters. The major aim of this framework is to eliminate the errors that arise from having the same information stored in several different documents that must be simultaneously maintained.
